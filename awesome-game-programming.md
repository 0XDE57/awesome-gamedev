# Awesome Game Programming #

This sub-list concerns itself exclusively with the programming side of game development, and lists the good stuff that relates to this. This list contains *only* [free software][1] for code and sellers and distributors who aren't evil for other resources.

The file is sorted by language where possible. Each section contains the following headers:

* **Engines:** This includes both game engines and physics engines.
* **Games:** Full games to draw inspiration from.
* **Libraries:** These are specifically game-oriented, or game-development-related, libraries.
