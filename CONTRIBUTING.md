# Contribution Guide #

First of all, thank for your contribution! I can't manage this whole thing
alone, and I welcome pull requests. To make sure that we're all on the same
page, here are some guidelines to follow for submitting pull requests for this
list.

## Ensure that everything you link to is free (as in freedom) ##

This is highly important - this list *only* contains freedom-respecting things!
If you are sending a pull request linking to code, ensure it is licensed under a
[freedom-respecting license][1]; if you are linking to assets of any kind, make
sure that [they are the same][2]. For games, be especially careful that they are
both.

## Indicate the license for anything you add clearly ##

Ensure that you use the correct name for the license (as per [this][1]
or [this][2]), and indicate any further restrictions clearly. Also check if the
license is in use already - if it is, don't create another link to it.

## Maintain alphabetical order within sections ##

Pretty self-explanatory, really. Numbers are considered to be higher-ordered
than anything else, and otherwise, lex order.

## Update the CHANGELOG.md ##

Follow the formatting there as an example. Make sure that you put entries in the
*past* tense - so you should have something like 'Fixed spelling errors in
license name', rather than 'Fix spelling errors in license name'.
