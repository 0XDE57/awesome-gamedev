# Wall of Shame #

This is a list of everything that did *not* make the list, or made the list and got cut. It is divided into two categories - one is stuff that *seems* free, but actually has severe nonfree dependencies, while the other is simply not clearly indicated one way or the other.

If you find anything on awesome-gamedev that should be put on the Wall of Shame, please let me know!
