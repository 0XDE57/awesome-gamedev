# To-do list #

This is not in order of priority.

* Section out the stuff on Saylor Academy to appropriate categories in Programming.
* Get license confirmation, and merge in, stuff from http://github.com/Moosader
* Sort the Wikiversity stuff into a proper Game Design learning resources category (possibly with more materials).
* Merge https://libregamewiki.org/Category:Engines into the rest of the list.
